# RigidSteelConnection-bachelorThesis
Rigid beam-beam, beam-column steel connection designing plugin to SOLDIS PROJEKTANT software. (Topic of our bachelor thesis in Civil Engineering Faculty at Poznań University of Technology).

## Getting started
Whole project was written in Python 2.7.
Unfortunetly this plugin cannot be run standalone, so I put here some pictures of it. There's the whole paper attached, where all algorithm are explained.
